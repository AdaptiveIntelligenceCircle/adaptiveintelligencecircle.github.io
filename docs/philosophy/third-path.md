# The Third Path

Modern systems oscillate between two extremes:

- Pure technological acceleration
- Pure institutional stagnation

The Third Path is neither.

It is the disciplined integration of:

- Technological adaptability
- Ethical governance
- Human meaning structures

The Third Path rejects collapse and rejects blind acceleration.

It seeks durable alignment.
