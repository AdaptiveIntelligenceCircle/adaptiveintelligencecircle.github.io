# What is AIC?

Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) is a research and governance initiative 
focused on designing adaptive systems that remain stable under long-term pressure.

AIC is not:

- A startup
- A product company
- A short-term research lab

AIC is:

- An institutional architecture initiative
- A resilience-oriented design movement
- A civilizational infrastructure project

The objective is to ensure intelligence remains aligned with 
ethical and structural stability.
