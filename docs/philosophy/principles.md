# Principles

AIC operates under the following principles:

## 1. Resilience over Speed
Systems must endure pressure.

## 2. Ethics Embedded in Architecture
Governance is not an add-on layer.

## 3. Adaptive Feedback Loops
Intelligence must self-correct.

## 4. Institutional Stability
Long-term structures matter more than short-term gains.

## 5. Human Meaning Preservation
Technology must reinforce meaning, not erode it.
