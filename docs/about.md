# About AIC.

Founded by Nguyễn Đức Trí (2004, HUST student) in 2025. Solo grind for 10 months to build a third path for AI – neither profit-driven nor state-controlled.

AIC is a non-profit, open-source ecosystem for ethical AI and human meaning in a post-scarcity future.

Join us if you believe in meaning over profit. Thank you.
