# About AIC.

Founded by Nguyễn Đức Trí (2004, HUST student) in 2025. Solo grind for 10 months to build a third path for AI – neither profit-driven nor state-controlled.

AIC is a non-profit, open-source ecosystem for ethical AI and human meaning in a post-scarcity future.

- Ethical from the kernel (AIC)
- Decentralized planetary network (AIN)
- Human Meaning Network (HMN)

## ⚙️ Core Principles
1. Transparency — All research and code are fully open under the Apache 2.0 license.

2. Adaptivity — Systems must evolve based on context, uncertainty, and prior knowledge.

3. Trust — Every component is designed for interpretability and reliability.

4. Human Alignment — AI should protect and augment, not replace, human capability.

5. Long-term Stability — Focus on controlled intelligence over uncontrolled power.

Together, these projects aim to form a distributed cognitive infrastructure —
bridging reasoning, security, and human-centered AI at the operating system level.


Our mission:  
- Build protocols for human-agent collaboration.  
- Encode knowledge into networks of meaning.  
- Explore the "Third Path" beyond scarcity and control.

Join us if you believe in meaning over profit. Thank you.
