# Architecture

AIC is not a framework — it is a **knowledge ecosystem** where humans and agents co-orchestrate meaning.

Explore our philosophy, networks, and vision for ethical AI in a post-scarcity world.

- Ethical from the kernel (AIC)
- Decentralized planetary network (AIN)
- Human Meaning Network (HMN)

## ⚙️ Core Principles
1. Transparency — All research and code are fully open under the Apache 2.0 license.

2. Adaptivity — Systems must evolve based on context, uncertainty, and prior knowledge.

3. Trust — Every component is designed for interpretability and reliability.

4. Human Alignment — AI should protect and augment, not replace, human capability.

5. Long-term Stability — Focus on controlled intelligence over uncontrolled power.

Together, these projects aim to form a distributed cognitive infrastructure —
bridging reasoning, security, and human-centered AI at the operating system level.

AIC architecture is modular, adaptive, and governance-aware.

## Core design features:

- Plugin-based extensibility
- Context-aware reasoning engines
- Self-defense modules
- Rollback and anomaly detection systems
