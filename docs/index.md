## A Civilizational Initiative

Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) is a long-term research and governance initiative 
focused on adaptive intelligence infrastructure.

We develop systems designed not merely for performance, 
but for resilience, ethical integrity, and societal continuity.

---

## Strategic Focus

- Adaptive AI Architecture  
- Institutional Governance Design  
- Human Meaning Networks  
- Secure Infrastructure and Self-Defense  

---

## Long-Term Vision

AIC exists to ensure that intelligence — artificial or human — 
remains aligned with civilizational stability.

This is not a product.
This is infrastructure.
