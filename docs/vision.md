# Vision

We envision a world where **AI and humans share meaning** in a decentralized ecosystem.  
AIC is about creating **ethical AI from the kernel**, ensuring that intelligence is aligned with human values.

Key points:  
- Post-scarcity society.  
- Human Meaning Network (HMN).  
- Adaptive Intelligence Network (AIN).
